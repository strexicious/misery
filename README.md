I'll beautify this README later, but here is how to build: 
- Get `libglfw3.a` into `libs` folder. 
- Get `GLFW/glfw3.h` into `headers` folder. 
- Get `glad` headers and source with the loader. 
- Get `imgui` folder in the root. Just download any release from github as zip and extract-rename. 
- Get `glm` headers. 
- Get `tinyobjloader` header and source file. 
- You need to have tup installed (or in your path) and just run `tup`. 

You can locate the binary at `build/misery.exe`.
